Just got back from FOSSHack today, definitely one of the best hackathon projects we've made so far. 36 hour hackathons feel so much better than 24 hour ones, can take breaks more frequently and rest better. Too bad I was sick for most of it though. Anyhow, checkout our project <a href="https://fossunited.org/hack/fosshack25/p/dk4pvsaqpo" class="text-blue-500 underline">here</a>.
