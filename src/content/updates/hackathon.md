Quick side quest this weekend: we're making an android app w/ Kotlin for <a href="https://fossunited.org/hack/fosshack25" class="text-blue-500 underline">FOSSHACK</a>. Frontend on mobile is so much nicer than CSS. Still not big on it though. 

Still haven't heard back from patch-hub's maintainer. Hopefully will get a reply soon so I can understand their vision and send in more meaningful PRs. If I don't, expect more OS/Kernel stuff this week.
