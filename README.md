# Blog

I can't think of anything creative to name this project nor do I think it really needs a specific name.

This is the source for [my blog](http://ivinjabraham.pages.dev/) hosted using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). It uses an [astro template](https://github.com/nicholasdly/miniblog) by [Nicholasdly](https://github.com/nicholasdly/). All posts are my own.
